## 📌 About
This is my personal portfolio that features two unique styles:
1. **Minimalist Dark Portfolio** – A simple, sleek portfolio with a modern design.
2. **Windows UI Desktop Portfolio** – A fully interactive Windows-like desktop experience where each part of the portfolio is an application.

## ✨ Features
- Two distinct portfolio styles.
- Windows UI experience with draggable, resizable windows.
- Interactive inbox UI that introduces the user to the portfolio.
- A simulated system crash leading to the desktop UI experience.
- Taskbar and window manager for better navigation.
- Animations with Framer Motion and Animate.css.
- Fully responsive design.

## 🎮 Usage
- The user starts on a landing page with a **bouncing arrow** pointing to the inbox button.
- Clicking it opens an **Email Inbox UI** with multiple emails.
- The first email is from **Kushal SM** and contains a `"View My Portfolio"` button.
- Clicking this **"crashes the system"** and brings the user to a **Windows UI desktop**.
- Desktop icons represent different portfolio sections (Projects, Skills, Resume, etc.), which can be **opened as draggable windows**.
- The `"portfolio.exe"` file, when clicked, **opens a terminal-like loader** before transitioning into the **Minimalist Dark Portfolio**.
